# type-arithmetic

Proofs of semiring properties over types (e.g. Curry-Howard Iso from traditional arithmetic into type cardinality) using Property Based Testing over term-level isomorphisms.

It's not exactly rigorous, but nobody's paying me for this, so you get what you get :P

Proofs are [here](./src/Lib.hs)
